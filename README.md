# Brain Teaser

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project I've created a complex brain teaser puzzle using Scratch's Operator blocks.

**<u>How it works</u>**

The aim of this brain teaser is to transport a lion, a donut, and a rooster from one side of a river to the other. You can fit one sprite in the boat at a time. However, if left unattended together, the lion will eat the rooster, and the rooster will eat the donut. The challenge is to work out the logic and get everything over to the other side of the river safely.
